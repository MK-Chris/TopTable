=head2 can_update($type)

1 if we can update the round $type; 0 if not.

In list context, a hash will be returned with keys 'allowed' (1 or 0) and potentially 'reason' (if not allowed, to give the reason we can't update).  The reason can be passed back in the interface as an error message.

No permissions are checked here, this is purely to see if it's possible to update the round based on factors in the tournament.

$type tells us what we want to update and can be "matches", "members", "auto-qualifiers", or "delete-matches".  If not passed, we get a hash (or hashref in scalar context) of all types - scalar context just returns 1 or 0 for all of these, list context returns the hashref with allowed and reason keys.  If nothing can be updated for the same reason (i.e., the season is complete), the types will not be returned, and you'll get a 1 or 0 in scalar context, or 'allowed' and 'reason' keys in list context, just as if it had been called with a specific type.

Possible $type values:
"auto-qualifiers": checks if we can change the number of auto-qualifiers from the group
"members": checks we can change the entrants for the group
"grid": checks if we can change the grid, or change whether we use a grid for this group
"grid-positions": checks if we can set / change the grid positions for the group
"matches": we're checking if we can add matches
"delete-matches": checks if we can delete matches from this group
